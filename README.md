# SentenceSimilarity

## Background

The research work is based on the the course ‘521158S Natural Language and Text Mining’ organized by the University of Oulu, Department of Computer Science and Engineering in November 2018 – January 2019 [*https://github.com/gunjanchandra280395/NLP-Project-18*]. 

The objective of the original project was to design and understand an approach that uses Google, Msn and, Youtube snippets in order to compute the semantic similarity between snippets using similarity measures such as overlapping words which is similar to Jaccard similarity, using Wikipedia dump files for finding the number of same documents for two given sentences, Sentence semantic similarity algorithm using WordNet etc. 

In the previous work, the evaluation of sentence similarity measurement was only conducted based on a few selected sentence pairs. Then considering how it resembles with human judges still needs more investigation. In the following work, we will continue to study the sentence similarity based on web search engines.

## Research questions
1. How does sentence similarity measurement resemble with human judge?
2. ...
